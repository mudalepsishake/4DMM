# 3DMMEx

3DMMEx is a source port of [Microsoft 3D Movie Maker](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-3D-Movie-Maker) that aims to preserve the classic 3D Movie Maker experience while adding minor enhancements for an improved user experience.

3DMMEx builds upon the amazing work of the [3DMMForever](https://github.com/foone/3DMMForever) project.

## Features

* Cross-platform support (in progress)
  * SDL2 graphics/input support
  * Linux platform support
* Portability improvements
  * Supports compiling with Visual Studio 2022, Clang and GCC
  * 64-bit support: supports compiling for x64 and ARM64
  * Inline assembly language code replaced with portable C++
  * Unit tests
* Usability improvements
  * Improved mouse input handling
  * New keyboard shortcuts for scrolling in browser dialogs
  * High-quality sound import

## Build

### Requirements

* CMake 3.28+
* Ninja build
* Windows:
  * Visual Studio 2022
    * Desktop development with C++ workload
    * Clang (optional)
* Linux:
  * GCC
  * Development libraries for SDL2, SDL2_ttf, gstreamer, GTK3, iconv and Fontconfig
  * Zenity (optional: used for dialog boxes)
  * [Comic Sans MS font](https://corefonts.sourceforge.net/) (optional but strongly recommended!)
  * gstreamer
  * Installing dependencies:
    * Ubuntu: `sudo apt install g++ cmake ninja-build libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libfontconfig-dev zenity`

### Building

Use CMake to build the project. The project includes a CMakePresets.json file that specifies [build presets](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html).

#### Building on Windows

* Open the Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio 2022 (or use a tool such as [VCVars](https://github.com/bruxisma/VCVars) to add the build tools to your path)
* Run `cmake --preset <preset-name>`:
  * x86 Debug build: `x86-msvc-debug`
    * Debug builds are recommended for local development and testing, as they have additional runtime checking that helps to identify bugs.
  * x86 Release build: `x86-msvc-relwithdebinfo`
  * There are additional presets for x64 builds and compiling with Clang instead of the Visual C++ compiler
* Run `cmake --build build\<preset-name> --target install`
  * The `--target install` is optional but recommended. This will create a directory `dist\<preset-name>` with the directory layout required for 3DMM to run.
  * Kauai development tools (eg. Chelp, Ched) are not built by default. You can build them by building the `tools` target.
* To run tests, run `ctest --test-dir build\<preset-name>`
* To build a release package, run `cmake --build build\<preset-name> --target dist`
  * A ZIP archive containing a portable install is created in the build directory.
  * If WiX is installed, an MSI package is also created.

#### Building on other platforms

* Run `cmake --preset <preset-name>`
  * The recommended preset is `sdl-debug` for local development, or `sdl-relwithdebinfo` for release.
* Run `cmake --build build/<preset-name> --target install`
* To run tests, run `ctest --test-dir build/<preset-name>`
* To run 3DMM, run `dist/<preset-name>/3dmovie`

## Legal stuff

The following sections have been carried over from the original 3D Movie Maker [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-3D-Movie-Maker) released by Microsoft in May 2022.

### Code cleanup

This code was restored from the Microsoft corporate archives and cleared for release.

* Developer names and aliases were removed, with the exception of current employees who worked on the
  original release who consented to keeping their names in place
* The archive consisted of several CDs, some of which were for alternate builds or products, and
  have been excluded
* The code does not build with today's engineering tools, and is released as-is.

This repo includes a build from 1995 of BRender from Argonaut software. Approval to open source BRender as MIT was given in an email from Jez San, former CEO of Argonaut. Other versions of BRender exist at <https://github.com/foone/BRender-v1.3.2> and <https://github.com/foone/BRender-1997> Thanks to Jez and the whole BRender team for their hard work on this amazing engine. A full historical list of BRender contributors is available at <https://github.com/foone/BRender-v1.3.2/blob/main/README.md>

This repo does NOT include the SoftImage SDK "./DKIT" from 1992.

Jez also offered this interesting BRender anecdote in an email:

```
When Sam Littlewood designed BRender, he didn’t write the code. And then document it.  
The way most things were built at the time.
First, he wrote the manual.  The full documentation
That served as the spec.  Then the coding started.
```
